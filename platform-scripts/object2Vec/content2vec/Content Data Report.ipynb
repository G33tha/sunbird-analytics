He looked to see the purple stone that his friend Goople had given him, glowed brightly. “What’s happening?” wondered Purple. “Hello, my friend, it’s Goople. Can you hear me? When glowing, the purple stone can act like your Earth telephone. Wanted to tell you I’m on my way to visit. See you in a bit.”  Purple was excited, “It’s been a while since I found the little space alien, Goople, under my bed. I wonder what adventure we’ll do together. We had such fun the last time when he took me for a ride through the solar system.” ', 'A few minutes later, Purple heard a ra- tat- tat,\\xa0 ra- tat- tat on his window pane. It was Goople wearing a big smile on his face. Opening the window, Goople jumped inside. “Great to see you, my friend, “said Goople as he reached to shake Purple’s hand. It’s been a while. Thought it was time we went on another adventure.” “Yes, Goople,” it’s great to see you, too,” replied Purple. “Where are we going to go?” ', '“Hang on tight,” said Goople as he gestured for Purple to grab on to him, “we are off to Mount Vesuvius, Italy.” In a flash, Purple and Goople were flying through the air towards the famous volcano.” I was just reading about volcanoes,” said Purple. “Volcanoes are mountains with a crater or opening where gases, steam, rocks and lava can come out of the earth’s crust. There are about 1510 active volcanoes on Earth. At least 80 volcanoes are underneath the ocean. What are we going to do at Mount Vesuvius?” ', 'Goople giggled, I’m taking you for a ride inside the earth. Mount Vesuvius, one of the world’s most famous volcanoes, is where we will enter”. It’s called an extinct volcano since it hasn’t erupted in a very, very long time.” Purple thought for a second and said, “Hope it doesn’t erupt now, either”. Purple added, “Did you know Goople that the outer layer of my planet Earth is called the crust? It is the crust where you’ll find all the continents and oceans. It goes down at least ten miles and is made mainly of rocks.” ', 'Whoosh, the two soon arrived at Mount Vesuvius and dove head first down, down, deep into the volcano. Stopping to explore a tunnel, Purple pointed excitedly, “Look, over there. I see stalactites hanging from the ceiling. They are so beautiful. They look like hundreds of icicles!” Three of the stalactites crashed to the ground with a thunderous plop, creating echoes for several minutes. Plop, Plop, Plop. “Yes, and look over there, those are stalagmites. Stalagmites differ from stalactites as they rise from the ground and not hang from the ceiling,” said Goople. ', 'Purple shouted above the increasing noise heard from deep inside the earth. “Both stalagmites and stalactites are formed from water droplets leaking through the ground. When the minerals in the water hardened, you got these cool shapes”. The friends continued their journey inside the earth. “Over there,” called Purple, “on the left, do you see the seashell fossils? And, oh, my, wow- there’s a fossil of \\xa0t-rex, the largest meat-eating dinosaur to ever walk the earth. This is amazing!” called Purple. ', 'Down, down they continued past beautiful pillars of clear, blue, pinks and green crystals. The clear crystals looked like stacks of ice cubes. “Gee, Goople, it’s getting really dark and hot.” shouted Purple. “Don’t worry, my friend, I’ve turned on my protective shield so we won’t feel the heat. And, I’ve turned on my antenna lights so you can see,” responded Goople. “I think we’ve reached the part of the earth called the mantle,” said Purple. It’s about 1800 miles thick and very hot- 5400 degrees F.” ', 'The pair continued down, down, down inside the earth. “Look, Goople, we’ve reached the earth’s core, the center of the earth. It has two parts. The outer core and the inner core. The outer core is so very hot that metals such as nickel and iron are in liquid form.” “Now, that’s HOT,” laughed Goople. “Yes, my planet has an outer and inner core, too,” smiled Goople. “And, just like my planet, it is in the earth’s core that the magnetic field is created.” ', 'Purple looked stumped. “Say Goople, what’s the magnetic field?” Goople replied, “Amazingly, the magnetic field goes all the way into outer space and helps protect both our planets from the sun’s harmful solar winds.” “Look, we’ve reached the inner core. But instead of liquid metals, it’s solid. How can that be?” asked Purple. It’s hotter than the outer core, as hot as the surface of the sun”. Goople knew the answer and explained, “That’s because there is so much pressure, it turns the liquid nickel and iron solid.” ', 'Purple spotted some glowing red and white liquid rock coming from the earth’s core. “That’s magma,” Purple said with awe. Goople added, “Magma is called lava once it cracks the earth’s surface.” Purple pointed to some magma that was beginning to gain speed bubbling up and up. The lava started chasing them as they began to zoom up toward the surface. “Hold on tight, my friend,” called Goople. “This might be a bumpy ride”. Whoosh! ', 'Goople and Purple returned to the earth’s surface through the opening of Eyjafjallajökull, one of the world’s most famous active volcanoes. Back on the surface, Purple and Goople sat down on the ground catching their breaths. “Sorry Purple, I didn’t realize that Iceland’s volcano was so active”. “That was the most awesome adventure, ever!” smiled Purple. “Hey, Purple, I’ve got something for you to remember our latest adventure,” smiled Goople. He reached into his pocket and handed Purple a bright orange rock. “Remember to tuck it into your shell”. ', '“I’m off. Need to get back to my planet in time for dinner. See you next time, my friend.” With that, Goople opened Purple’s bedroom window and flew off, back to his home planet far, far away. “Bye, Goople,” Purple called from the window.   Purple looked down at the bright orange stone he was holding in his hand. He tucked the orange rock into his shell right next to his purple stone. ', \"This is the story of a little fir tree who dreamt of growing up so that he could go and be a Christmas Tree amongst the Humans. The other, older trees, knew more about life, and they told him that being a tree with the Humans wasn't as good as all that.\\xa0  But the little fir tree didn't want to believe the older trees and he didn't have long to wait. \", 'He was so pleased when one day some children came with their parents to choose a fir tree to decorate their living room. The children adored him at first sight. ', 'So he was dug up, then brought into the living room, where he was hung with decorations. ', 'After they had finished decorating him, the little fir tree shone with a thousand lights. ', 'Christmas was getting closer and everyone admired the little Christmas Tree. The young fir tree thought: All the bigger fir trees were wrong and he lifted his branches even higher so people could admire him better. Up till January, he was the prince of the living room; but then he started to lose his needles. Now nobody looked at him, touched him, or even bothered to gather up the tiny needles that fell.\\xa0  Then, the whole family decided to put him down into the cellar. The fir tree started to feel very sad that he had even been chosen by the family. ', \"After several days wait it seemed never-ending to him, the little fir tree was replanted. He was so happy to be back in this good old earth that he'd missed so much during those endless days when he was shut up in the cellar!! Suddenly he understood that the family had left him in the cold of the cellar to keep him healthy. \", 'Each year, the family dug him up again to put him back into the living room. He was very happy with his new family. And yes, in the end the bigger trees were wrong about something- some humans are good after all... ', 'Happy Birthday, Jesus!
