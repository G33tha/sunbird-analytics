All of us went to the Dasara Fair.
It was the Annual Haircut Day for Sringeri Srinivas.
My name is Ramu. One day, we went to a Dasara fair

On the way home, a very strong wind came. It blew my cap away.
But the barber said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
Meals of the day
So the fruit sellers tried.
Feeling sad, Sringeri Srinivas went back home to ask his wife for help.
My cap got stuck on a branch of the old Pipal tree.
The rope makers tried.
But his wife said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
Feeling a little angry, Sringeri Srinivas went to his friend, the tailor.
The jewellers tried.
Later that night, the moon came up. It looked at my cap on the old Pipal tree.
It tried on my cap. The moon smiled happily. I smiled too.
But the tailor said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
The royal ministers tried.
After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap."The moon sent it," she said.
Even the court scientists tried. At last one of them said, “My little daughter Lilavati can help us.”
Now a little worried, Sringeri Srinivas went to one more friend, the carpenter.
So the King called Lilavati. Lilavati thought. And thought. And thought. At last she had an idea!
But the carpenter said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
Do you think the sun needs a hat?.
She led the King’s roly- poly elephant to the river.
Poor Sringeri Srinivas. It seemed no one would cut his hair on this Annual Haircut Day.
And got the chubby- happy little elephant into a boat.
In tears, he walked off by himself past the village forest.
The boat sank and sank and sank. When it sank no more, Lilavati made a mark on the boat.
He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
"The day is nearly over. How can I keep my promise to cut my hair? Oh God, help me!"
Then she got the elephant out of the boat. And the boat was filled up with stones. When the boat sank up to the mark, Lilavati said, “Stop!”
The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was very disturbed by all the noise.
Now weigh the stones. And subtract my weight. “And that, O King, is the weight of your elephant!”
He came out, roaring, waving his giant paws at Sringeri Srinivas.
Poor Sringeri Srinivas was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... all the hair fell off his head!
Sringeri Srinivas ran all the way back to the village. The tiger went back to sleep.
Now, Sringeri Srinivas will not need a haircut for a very long time.
